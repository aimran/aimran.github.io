####Interests
  
My research is in the field of high-energy gamma-ray astrophysics. This field
studies the most energetic processes in the Universe, including cosmic objects
such as super-massive black holes, expanding supernova remnants, exploding
stars, and colliding neutron stars. In this energy band, the Universe is
dominated by non-thermal emissions in the form of gamma-ray photons. These
distant photons were produced in some of the most violent astrophysical
environments ever known. I am interested in the emission and propagation
mechanisms of these cosmic particles -- *how are they produced, how do they
acquire such extreme energies, how do they propagate through the intervening
extragalactic space?* Gamma-ray astronomy allows us to explore these questions
that can in turn give us important clues to the structure and formation history
of the Universe.


####Current Research
  
At present, I am a research associate at the [Wisconsin IceCube Particle
Astrophysics Center](www.wipac.wisc.edu) (WIPAC). I am taking part in the
construction  and operation of the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
observatory in Mexico as part of a multinational collaboration of scientists.
At HAWC, I am leading the effort to observe and understand flaring gamma ray
emission from active galaxies. I am also developing software analysis tools to
conduct searches for extremely bright but short transient events in the
gamma-ray sky observed by HAWC. I make extensive use of image analysis,
constrained optimization techniques, and Bayesian probability theory for my
research.

Prior to WIPAC, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Los Alamos National
Laboratory](lanl.gov) (LANL) in New Mexico. During my time at LANL, I designed
and developed the main data acquisition system for HAWC. This VME-based
high-throughput system forgoes a traditional hardware trigger and applies all
triggering of the data stream in the software.

####Background
  

I obtained my undergraduate degree in physics from [Grinnell
College](www.grinnell.edu).  The grace of a small town, perfectly blended with
the idyllic scenes of Iowa provided an ideal place to immerse oneself in physics
along with an eclectic menu of coursework (ancient Chinese history, *Mapping
the Realm of Religion* and modern physics all in one semester!). It was at
Grinnell, where I got introduced to the amazing world of gamma-ray astronomy
through a mentored advanced project with [Charlie
Duke](http://www.grinnell.edu/users/duke). The intrigue of
detecting faint signals that are coming from the vast reaches of our galaxy and
beyond eventually led me to pursue doctoral studies at the [Iowa State University
](www.iastate.edu)(ISU) with [Frank
Krennrich](http://www.physastro.iastate.edu/directory/krennich). As part of my
dissertation, I developed an analysis framework to analyze variable
gamma-ray emissions from active galaxies using the
[VERITAS](veritas.sao.arizona.edu) observatory in Sourthern Arizona.
