####About
---------- 
Hi! I am Asif Imran and I am an astrophysicist at the Wisconsin IceCube Particle
Astrophysics Center. My background is in experimental astrophysics with a strong
emphasis on data analysis and instrumentation. As a data researcher, I get to
combine several of my passions into one -- science, statistics, and programming.
I spend a majority of my time poring over large amount of data to
search for elusive gamma-ray signals from distant galaxies. 

I am a big fan of the *python* programming language. My data-driven approach to
research translates to a never-ending list of intrigues or questions throughout
the day. The nimbleness of the python framework allows me better focus on these
questions without getting bogged down by the programmaing language itself. While
I am on the topic, let me also mention the fabulous *[IPython
notebook](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)*.
Ever since I discovered it back in 2010, we have become inseperable. I can
prototype my ideas into working algorithm, create plots, and document
my work all at the same time.

I am also prone to obsessing about generating *good looking* plots. I find that the
process of reducing a seemingly vast dataset into answers about the fundamental
nature of cosmos is incomplete  without clear and intuitive visualization.

Finally, in my spare time, I love tinkering with arduino boards, reading manuals and
spending time with my lovely 2 year old daughter and my wife!
